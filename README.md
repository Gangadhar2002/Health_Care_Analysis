# Health_Care_Analysis

We used Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and SQL to study Axon Healthcare data.
Excel cleaned and shaped the data. SQL fetched and joined tables. Tableau made deep charts and maps. Power BI made dashboards for daily use and filters.

# Problem statement
Make one view of doctors, patients, treatments, diagnosis, and revenue so managers can see workload, top doctors, top treatments, and money trends. Use tools to clean, analyze, and show results.

# Key insights (tool + insight)

Excel (cleaning & calc): removed dupes, fixed nulls, made month table, currency convert. This gave clean data for BI.
SQL (data prep): joined patient, visit, lab, and billing tables; computed counts, avg age, follow-up rate. Fast and repeatable.
Tableau (explore & reports): showed top 5 diagnoses, map of revenue by state, and top doctors by revenue. Good for deep drill down.
Power BI (operational dashboards): showed doctor workload, treatment share (vaccination, surgery, meds, phys therapy ~25% each), KPI cards (total patients 10K, doctors 1K, avg age 49). Easy filters and share with team.

# Business actions (very short)
Rebalance doctor load to cut overload.
Focus revenue ops in top states (Texas, Florida).
Run programs for Hypertension & Diabetes (most chronic cases).
Track follow-up to raise it (Tableau shows drop; Power BI shows mid-level). Use SQL jobs to run weekly reports.

# Conclusion
Using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau together gave clear and accurate healthcare insights. It helped Axon Healthcare track doctor performance, patient trends, and revenue easily, leading to smarter and faster decisions.
